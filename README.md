# PIC16F877A Embedded C Projects ðŸš€

This repository contains **Embedded C programs** for the **PIC16F877A microcontroller**, developed using **MPLAB X IDE** and simulated on **PICSimLab** and **Proteus**. The goal is to master **Embedded C programming** while learning **hardware-level control** of microcontrollers.
